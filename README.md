# Predicting-Secondary-School-Student-Performance
Dataset contains various features of 395 Portuguese secondary school to identify whether the student performs well in the final grade exam using the evaluation of different machine learning models on the dataset with the best accuracy possible.
The constraint in the given dataset is that we have only 395 students data which is limited and cannot be used for accurate prediction but will be sufficient to some extent of accuracy. And we need to assume only a few attributes to get the accuracy of predicting the student performance in the model. If we use all the attributes the model accuracy will be incorrect and cannot reap the expected results. 
All the variables in the dataset are either integers or strings or Boolean values. There are 33 attributes in the data set.
To analyze or predict the low performance in the math scores in the two Portuguese secondary schools, we will be using supervised learning techniques like linear regression, logistic regression, and Random Forest Regression which will be implemented using python. The use of labeled datasets to train algorithms that reliably classify data or predict outcomes is what supervised learning is all about.
